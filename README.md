                    A tree data structure can be definedÂ recursively as a collection of nodes, where each node is a data structure consisting of a value and a list of references to nodes. The start of the tree is the "root node" and the reference nodes are the "children". No reference is duplicated and none points to the root.

                     A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels. In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type.
